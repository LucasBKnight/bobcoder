the latest exe files are in the "exefiles" folder, go nuts. Note that "BobcoderM[insert async ver number]" is the Mac version and "BobcoderW[insert async ver number]" is the Windows version

**Current Release Versions** 
------------------------------------------------------------
(version #s are synced here, if it says its a newer release it is.)

**Bobcoder MacOS Ver 0.1.2 Beta**
  
  Two stage encoding and copy paste QOL features added from last time

**Bobcoder Windows Ver 0.1.1 Beta**
  
  One stage encoding as unicode encoding is finicky with language based unicode. this means when I add the second encoding pass to the windows version it will have to be longer unless I find a solution
